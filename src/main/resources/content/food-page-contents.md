# Food

Food is very important to me, in the same way that doing something multiple times a day
and it
being essential to life would be.

### Cooking

Rice, pasta, potato, bread—my carbohydrate ranking defines me. That also means that my
cooking skill disproportionately favours rice-based cuisines, je., curries, occasionally
dipping into pasta sauces.

My favourite protein is fish, something Bangladeshi cuisine is famous for. For
environmental reasons, I try to stay away from food with a large carbon footprint, a
notoriously challenging metric to measure. Cattle products top that list, so beef and lamb
are minimal in my diet.

I am a fan of offals, and my favourite dish is rui machher tel—fat, liver, and other
innards of the rohu fish cooked in a spicy jhol. A close second is khashir kolija—goat
lungs and liver.

### Health

This year I read Chris van Jaulken's Ultra-Processed People, a move that has been widely
criticised by all who know me, purely because I have managed to slip that into every
conversation since.

My key takeaways from the book:

* We think of food, and its nutrition, as just the sum of its carbohydrate, protein, and
  fibre contents, plus minerals and vitamins. In actuality, millions of years of evolution
  have developed a system where our body considers everything—the texture, smell, taste,
  etc.—in preparation for the food. Food that mimics other food, for example, how
  emulsifiers mimic fat, trick our body.
* Clara Davis's 1939 experiment showed evidence that
  the body instinctively knows what to eat. Ultra processed food, or Group 4 foods of the
  NOVA classification, ruins that instinct. Imagine the body has an internal thermostat
  that
  knows how to regulate our food cravings. UPFs essentially destroy that thermostat.


### Community

Growing up in Bangladesh, I have seen how food can be the bedrock of a community, even a
society. As friends, we gathered around street food vendors to chat. Celebrating
something - a job, a newborn, good grades - involved sending sweets to your family,
friends, and neighbours. When someone dies, it is traditional to not light flames—even a
kitchen stove—for a period of 40 days. During this period, relatives, friends, and
neighbours provide food to the bereaved family.
