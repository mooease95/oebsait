### Ultimate Frisbee

My main sport. Quick link to the [rules.](https://www.ukultimate.com/rules-of-ultimate)

Over the years, I have played with a lot of teams: Bath University Ultimate, Glasgow
Ultimate, Zero Degrees, Zoo, and, most recently, Curve. I played BUCS at University at
Regional level.


### Badminton

Just 4 friends who want to keep in touch. Rackets and corks make it more fun!


### Gym

Rehabilitation following my ACL reconstruction surgery continues through this
strengthening aspect of SPORTS. I go to the gym 0-2 times a week, and I solely do leg
workouts, occasionally interspersed with some back. Almost 2 years of this routine has
made my knees stable, my runs less injurious, and finding fitting trousers a proper
challenge.


### Yoga

Taking advantage of a weekly free class courtesy of my employers, this is the latest
SPORTS I have picked up.


### Hiking

We are now going into activities that I love but will probably do twice a year.


### Table Tennis

About the only sport I care about being good at. Not enough to take lessons or anything,
but enough to be annoyed when a nice spin is returned.


### Cricket

We're hitting rock bottom. Cricket is huge in Bangladesh and I grew up playing a lot of it
in the streets. Unfortunately, that means the only shot I play is a straight drive. My
preference is to bowl leg-spin, but the only time I played in a full 22-yard pitch, those
did not reach anywhere near the batsman. At the only school tournament, I was a
wicket-keeper with one run-out to my name in two matches.


### Football

Through unfortunate experience, I have found football to be the worst sport for my ACL. It
is a sport I avoid completely now.


### Basketball

Can you believe this 169cm boy once captained the school's house basketball team?? I
haven't played since the school days. My basketball shenanigans are now limited to having
the high score at the arcade basketball games.
