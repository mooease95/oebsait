# Engineering

## Work

By day, I am a low-latency Java developer at the Royal Bank of Canada. I enjoy
thinking about how my code will impact performance. More often than not, it takes me
down a fun rabbit hole of research.

Some of the core technologies I use are: Spring, aeron, artio, agrona, etc.

## Personal Dabblings

Is there a greater rush than creating a new GitHub repo, committing "initial commit",
and then never touching it again? Here are some of the things I have dabbled with.

### Generative AI

As a passionate hater of frontend development, GenAI opened up a new world of
possibilities. This whole website is pretty much generated by Gemini and Junie (Google
and JetBrains respectively).

### Rust

It's hard to navigate any technology space online without someone shoving Rust down
your throat. So naturally, I've played around with it. It is still early days - I am
trying to redo one of my Java courseworks from university in Rust. The low-latency
possibilities of Rust are pretty exciting!

### wobbbles

wobbbles is a CRUD gym application written with my friend. A test version has been
published on the Android Play Store. Lot of comments were received, which are yet to
be implemented.

## Projects at University

As a Computer Science alumnus of the University of Bath, I have had my share of
projects. There is only worth mentioning here though.

### SENTiment

For my final year project, I worked on a messaging application that used a third-party
API to run sentiment analysis on messages. Supervised by Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) professors, the aim of the project was to find the most optimum depiction of
emotion/ sentiment/ affect in a messaging application. The application was written for
Android using Java.
